#+TITLE: Gemini REPL Development Context
#+AUTHOR: AI Assistant Session
#+DATE: 2025-07-14

* Project Overview

** Purpose
Building a ClojureScript REPL for interacting with the Gemini API, featuring formal specifications, literate programming, and self-hosting capabilities.

** Development Philosophy
- Literate programming with org-mode
- Formal verification with TLA+/Alloy
- Git notes for prompt tracking
- Incremental development through phases
- AI-assisted development with context preservation

* Technical Architecture

** Core Technologies
- ClojureScript with Shadow-CLJS
- Node.js interop for system features
- Gemini API for LLM interaction
- Formal methods for specification

** Key Components
*** REPL Core (src/gemini_repl/core.cljs)
- Main namespace with readline interface
- Conversation history management
- API request handling with proper error handling
- Command processing (/help, /exit, /clear, /stats, /context)

*** Logging System
- Dual logging: FIFO and file
- JSON structured logs
- Environment-based configuration
- Silent error handling

*** UI Features
- ASCII art banner on startup
- Compact metadata display
- Confidence indicators (ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ¡ ðŸ”´)
- Token counting and cost estimation

* Development History

** Phase Progression
1. Basic Setup - Repository initialization
2. Project Structure - Literate setup documents
3. Claude Integration - AI assistant commands
4. Node.js Setup - ClojureScript environment
5. GitHub Integration - Workflows and templates
6. Badges and Labels - Visual indicators
7. Formal Specifications - TLA+ and Alloy specs
8. API Integration - Gemini API connection
9. Logging Implementation - FIFO and file logging
10. UI Enhancements - ASCII banner
11. Conversation Context - History tracking
12. Development Infrastructure - Live reload, tmux
13. Metadata Display - Compact UI improvements
14. Quality Gates - Linting and testing
15. Release System - Semantic versioning
16. AI Context - Resurrection system (current)

** Notable Events
*** The Great Parenthesis Rebuild
- Phase 14 implementation hit complex nesting issues
- Multiple attempts to fix parenthesis matching
- User wisdom: "think harder ; just rebuild the whole thing"
- Complete rebuild of make-request function
- Documented in issue #13

*** Key User Guidance
- Use gmake instead of make
- Use --trailer for co-authorship
- No "generated with" in commit messages
- Conventional commits format

* Current State

** Completed Features
- Interactive REPL with slash commands
- Full conversation context preservation
- Structured logging system
- Formal specifications
- Development tools integration
- Release automation
- Quality assurance pipeline

** In Progress
- AI Context Resurrection system
- Self-hosting platform design

** Upcoming
- Self-modification capabilities
- Git worktree experiments
- Research documentation automation

* Development Patterns

** Git Workflow
- Conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- Git notes for prompt tracking
- Co-authorship trailers
- Semantic versioning

** Testing Strategy
- Shadow-CLJS test runner
- Expect-based REPL tests
- Linting with clj-kondo
- Pre-release validation

** Documentation
- Org-mode for literate programming
- README with examples
- Command documentation
- Formal specifications

* Lessons Learned

** Technical
- ClojureScript parenthesis matching requires careful attention
- Forward declarations needed for mutual recursion
- Node.js interop works well with Shadow-CLJS
- Environment variables provide flexible configuration

** Process
- Phased development helps manage complexity
- Git notes provide excellent prompt tracking
- AI context preservation is crucial for long sessions
- Formal specifications catch design issues early

* Future Directions

** Self-Hosting Capabilities
- REPL modifying its own code
- Experiment isolation with git worktrees
- Automated research documentation
- Hot-reload for immediate testing

** Enhanced AI Integration
- Multi-model support
- Advanced prompt engineering
- Context window optimization
- Cost tracking and optimization

** Community Features
- Plugin system
- Shared prompt libraries
- Collaborative experiments
- Research publication tools
