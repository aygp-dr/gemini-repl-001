# RFC-001: Formal Validation Framework

## Summary

Establish a formal validation framework using TLA+ and Alloy to ensure the Gemini REPL behaves correctly and safely.

## Motivation

As we build a self-modifying REPL that can execute AI-generated code, we need strong guarantees about system behavior. Formal methods provide mathematical proof of correctness.

## Design

### TLA+ Specifications

- Model the REPL state machine
- Specify command processing invariants
- Define safety properties for API interactions

### Alloy Models

- Model data structures and their constraints
- Verify structural properties
- Check for edge cases in system design

### Integration

- CI/CD pipeline runs verification on every change to specs
- Failing specs block merges to main
- Documentation links specs to implementation

## Implementation Plan

1. Define core system properties in TLA+
2. Create Alloy models for data structures
3. Set up CI/CD verification
4. Document mapping between specs and code

## Alternatives

- Property-based testing only (less rigorous)
- No formal verification (higher risk)
- Different formal methods tools

## Open Questions

- Performance impact of verification in CI/CD
- Learning curve for contributors
- Maintenance burden of keeping specs in sync
